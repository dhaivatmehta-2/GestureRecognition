# GestureRecognition
We all use hand gestures, using a laptop/pc cam, my project can recognize different hand gestures of number 1,2,3,4,5.


...this project serves as a framework which can futher be expanded to identify more hand gestures such as thumbs up and so on 

• made using python and openCV

• incase the camera doesnt work, change the following line of code in main.py- 0 to 1

• cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

• some part of code is commented out as i am planning to use this project as a foundation for another future project
